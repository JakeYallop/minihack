# Balloon Story

The green team - Ben, Jake, James.  
This month's theme was 'stories', and our idea was to have paragraphs appear as a user controlled hot air balloon passed certain checkpoints.

## What we managed to do:

Using kaboom.js we scraped through the docs to make this - a balloon sprite that moves down constantly, with upward acceleration provided by user input on the spacebar. It also features a mountain range in the background.

## What we would have done, given about 15 minutes more:

We were minutes away from coding the collision event to begin the 'game' loop.  
Next steps would be:

- Parallax style moving background
- Vertical checkpoints to pass through and render paragraphs of the story
- Speed of the balloon increases with altitude
- Maybe some sort of bonus for landing in certain areas or something
