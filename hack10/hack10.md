# Task

The theme for Hack 10 is stories.  You need to tell a story using the most diverse and imaginative technology you can.

There should be some element of interactivity to the story.


# Suggestions

* Create a simple text based application that displays the story, but asks the user what to do next (a la select your own adventure).

* A web-site that displays a pictoral story, but the user needs to click a simple button to progress.

* An IoT device that transmits the story in morse code, but waits for acknowledgements after each line.

* An Excel spreadsheet that allows you to navigate the story using the tabs.
