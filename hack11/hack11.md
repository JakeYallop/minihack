# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends are planning to steal a huge diamond from a very expensive jewelry shop.

### Planning Phase

Before you can even start planning, you need to obtain some plans of underground tunnels that, for some reason, run directly underneath the jewelry shop.

The plans are held in a safe, for which the key is a specific sound or tune.  However, you can't store the recording as a sound, lest the authorities may discover it on your computer.

## Name That Tune

The task is to capture the sound without recording the sound itself as a sound file.

### Name That Tune - Bonus

The ability to translate the recording back to a sound.  This doesn't have to be the same sound.


# Suggestions

* Create a graph of the sound (like a 1980 hi-fi equalizer).

* Store the sound as an image.

* Record all the sounds above a given frequency in one file, and all below in another.
