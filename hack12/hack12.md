# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends are planning to steal a huge diamond from a very expensive jewelry shop.

### Planning Phase

You have the plans, but there's a problem: the planning department have noticed that they're missing.  You have managed to pursuade the head of the planning department that the plans have been ligitimately taken by the water-board; however, they want to check.


## The Turing Test

Create something that, when investigated, convinces the planning department representative that the plans have been taken by the water board, and not stolen.

# Suggestions

1. Create a chat bot, or Eliza clone, that, when interrogated, fools the planning department into believing that the plans have been legitimately taken.

2. Create a Skype or Whatsapp clone that responds to questions.

3. A program that synthesizes speach and explains what happened to the plans.
