re: Building Plans

Dear Mr Jaques,

John Kilimister Smith from Severn Water Customer Relations here.

Thank you for your ongoing support and loyalty.

We are writing to let you know that we recently requested and received your shop's plans as part of our current emergency work to reduce water leakage.

The plans requested are part of our emergency work to ensure we reduce water leakage. As you may have seen on todays BBC article https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53351401 all water boards are requesting plans from their customers.

For more information please refer to our website https://www.stwater.co.uk/businesses/overview/
