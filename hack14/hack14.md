# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends are planning to steal a huge diamond from a very expensive jewelry shop.

### Execution Phase

The heist is planned!  You're going to tunnel under the shop and drill up.  Once you're through, the alarm is going to be disabled, you can grab the jewels and make a run for it!

There's just one problem - Santa!

A small man dressed as Santa lives behind the shop.  There's a risk he'll hear the commotion; however, he has one weakness: he can't resist long, rhyming words - the longer the better.


## Jingle Bells

In a 30 second window, display on the screen as many words as you can.  There's no judge, and keep your own score - here's the rules:

1 point per letter of the word, unless the word is not a valid English word (in which case, no points)

+2 points per rhyming word

Each word must display for at least 1 second


# Suggestions

* You could simply type as many rhyming words into word as you can think of

* Create an application that uses the APIs in the resources below to find and print words on the screen
