# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends are planning to steal a huge diamond from a very expensive jewelry shop.

### Execution Phase

The heist is planned!  You're going to tunnel under the shop and drill up.  Once you're through, the alarm is going to be disabled, you can grab the jewels and make a run for it!

Having distracted Santa, the next task is to make sure that you're not caught on the way out.

When you leave the shop, you'll need to plan a route that avoids the police.


## The Great Escape

Your task is to create something that can plan a route between two locations, but avoiding certain points on a map.  The points can change suddenly (as the police relocate), which should cause a recalculation of the route.


# Suggestions

* You could simply bring up Google / Bing Maps and manualy map a route that avoids given points

* You could use the Geo Location co-ordinates in SQL Server to map proximity

* You could use the Google / Bing Maps API
