# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends are planning to steal a huge diamond from a very expensive jewelry shop.

### Aftermath

The heist is was successful!  You've taken the diamond and escaped the police.  The next problem is that now you have a priceless, and very recognisable, diamond.

You've found a contact that can offload your diamond in an underground auction.  It's too dangerous to attend in person, so you need to automate the negotiations.


## Fire sale

Your task is to create something that can negotiate for your diamond, and get the highest price.


# Suggestions

* You could use a chat bot framework to create a simple chat bot that negotiates

* Create your own chat bot / negotiator

* Create a console app that accepts a price and replies yes or no

* Use an Excel macro to accept or decline a price
