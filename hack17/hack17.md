# Task

## Overall Story so far

You and some friends have stolen a huge diamond from a very expensive jewellery shop.  
You've fenced the diamond for a fair price.

### Aftermath

The heist is was successful!  You've taken the diamond, escaped the police, and fenced it for a good price!

However, there is some dispute as to how the money is split.  You decide that whoever can launder the money best can keep it.

Your contact tells you that to launder the money, you need to transfer each individual pound into a separate account - 
each account number is a prime number, so 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. are all valid accounts.

In order to run this, you need to run it on the bank's computer without their knowledge!


## Face-off!

Your task is to create a process that finds account numbers and transfers money, but to disguise the process so that it's not obvious that it's running.


# Suggestions

* Disguise the executable as something else - for example an image.

* Make the running executable look like a windows process.

* Create something that can lay dormant on the target machine and be triggered by a web-site.

* Create an Excel Macro that appears to be a standard spreadsheet until you press a button.
