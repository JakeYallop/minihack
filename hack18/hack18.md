# Task

## Overall Story so far

Following on from a recent windfall, you decide to visit the races as your friend says he's got a hot tip in the 2:35 at Kempton

### The Races

You visit the races, completely unaware of anything going on.  However, shortly after arriving, you realise that there's a dispute amongst the Jockeys.  They're arguing over whether blinkers help.


## The Task

You're provided with a data file that lists the form for the past year.  Design a solution to either display or interpret this data.


# Suggestions

* Import the data into Excel and display a graph.

* Use a machine learning algorythim to analyse the data.

* Animate a version of the horserace that will predict the winner (based on the blinkers).
