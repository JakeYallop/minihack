# Task

## Overall Story so far

You visited the races with a recent windfall, and you have analysed for the jockeys whether blinkers help with the race.  

### Training

After your excellent work, the jockeys approach you with a request.  They want you to produce something that will help them in the race.  You have a chat to the jockeys, and they give you the following problems that they have:
- Knowing when a jump is approaching
- Choosing colours
- Race modelling


## The Task

From the problems that the jockeys have told you about, pick one to help them with.  The race course is of your own design.  You're free to use the stats from MiniHack 18.


# Suggestions

* An IoT device that buzzes when a jump is approaching.

* A web site that matches colours.

* Animate a version of the horse race that will predict the winner (based on the stats).
