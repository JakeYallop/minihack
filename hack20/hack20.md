# Task

## Overall Story so far

You're having a great time at the racetrack after a recent windfall.

### The Race

There has been a disaster at the race track.  A number of the jockeys 
have gone on strike over a dispute over the colours they've been asked to wear.

## The Task

The owners of the track have asked if you would be able to simulate the race,
based on what you know so far.

Remember that you have some stats from Hack 18.

# Suggestions

* Animate a version of the horse race that will predict the winner (based on the stats from Hack 18).

* Using machine learning, predict the order of the finishers based on the stats.

* Create an Excel sheet with the stats and draw a graph that lets you predict the winners.
